    "reasoning": "I first enumerated all peer-reviewed or widely-cited arXiv papers (post-2023) surfaced by the refined queries, keeping only those directly addressing user-conditioned alignment or personalisation of LLMs. Twenty-one distinct papers were retained.  I then designed a 6-section narrative that moves logically from motivation through taxonomy, techniques, federated/privacy issues, evaluation, and finally open challenges.  To respect the citation-coverage rules, I distributed the papers so each appears at least once, re-using a paper only when its contribution is central to multiple sections and flagging that reuse via a \"comment\" field.  Within every section I created 2-3 key points, each backed by 2 papers (3 where helpful) with concise summaries and an explicit citation_reason explaining their relevance.  This yields balanced coverage, minimal but justified reuse, and a clear roadmap for a graduate-level review.",
