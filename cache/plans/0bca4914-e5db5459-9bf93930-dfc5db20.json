    "reasoning": "I chose five sections that reflect a typical pipeline in this research area: we motivate why personalisation/conditional alignment matters, classify existing work, drill into methods, examine how they are evaluated, and close with open problems. I first listed 16 post-2023, widely-cited arXiv papers spanning offline/online RLHF, prompt and adapter methods, in-context preference learning, cross-lingual/group adaptation, evaluation benchmarks, and device-level deployment. To satisfy the distribution rules, every paper appears at least once, and no bullet re-uses more than three papers; re-use is restricted to highly central studies (e.g., Aligning LMs with Offline HF and SPAC) and is justified in citation_reason. Each section has three key points (total 15), with 2 distinct papers each (30 citations). This yields even coverage while keeping the review concise and coherent.",
