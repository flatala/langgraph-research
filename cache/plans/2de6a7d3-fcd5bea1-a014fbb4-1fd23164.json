    "reasoning": "I chose the canonical six-section structure requested by the user and ordered them to progress from motivation to future work, which creates a logical narrative arc.  Sixteen post-2023 papers were available, satisfying the \u226515 requirement.  Papers were first bucketed by dominant contribution (problem framing, taxonomy, algorithmic method, benchmark, application, or forward-looking insight).  I then mapped each paper to at least one section, checking that every section had fresh citations and that no single paper dominated more than two sections (duplication was allowed only for conceptually central works such as LaMP and MetaAligner).  Key points were limited to 2\u20134 per section to keep the review focused; each key point cites 2\u20133 distinct primary papers.  Privacy-preserving personalization and multilingual safety, previously under-represented, are now covered via DP-FPL, PriME and Multilingual Blending.  Foundational but recent alignment techniques (e.g., Offline LFHF, Aligner) appear early to motivate later discussions of privacy, evaluation and challenges.  This distribution avoids citation gaps, minimises redundancy, and supports a coherent, graduate-level literature review.",
