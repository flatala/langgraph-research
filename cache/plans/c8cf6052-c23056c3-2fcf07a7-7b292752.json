    "reasoning": "The outline follows a classic top-down structure used in graduate-level reviews. Six sections move from broad context (Background) through organisation of the field (Taxonomy), technical detail (Methods), empirical practice (Evaluation), real-world uptake (Applications/Mitigation) and finally forward-looking discussion (Open Challenges). 11 distinct, highly-cited arXiv papers published \u2265 2023 are distributed so every paper is cited at least once and no section is dominated by repeats. Two works (PLMM, MetaAligner) are intentionally reused across multiple sections because they are pivotal: PLMM is the first full pipeline for privacy-preserving personalised LLMs, while MetaAligner is the only method offering generalisable multi-objective alignment\u2014hence their presence in Background/Methods/Applications and Taxonomy/Methods/Challenges respectively is explicitly justified. All other papers appear exactly once, achieving balanced coverage of personality alignment, multilingual safety, code-switching, adapter approaches, memory-augmented web agents, and explainable benchmarks.",
