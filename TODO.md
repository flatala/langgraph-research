- Simplify grounding review to match the structure of content review - so for each issue we get single detailed point (include arxiv id, citation, rexplanation, reccomendation, etc)

- Consider adding two message threads - quality and grounding review that are fed to the model as a whole

- Add image figure parsing

- Try loading whole papers into the context when writing a subsection instead of the rag (it should fit)

- First to grounding refinement, then do content refinement
